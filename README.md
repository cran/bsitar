## bsitar

The **bsitar** package provides an interface for Bayesian implementation
of Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) growth model.
The SITAR is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits a
natural cubic spline mean curve and aligns individual-specific growth
curves to the underlying mean curve via a set of random effects: the
size, timing and intensity. The **bsitar** package package is a
front-end to the R package **brms** which uses the **Stan** program to
performing full Bayesian inference for a range of regression
specifications including hierarchical multivariate modeling.
