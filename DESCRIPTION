Description: The Super Imposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) model 
    is a shape-invariant nonlinear mixed effect model that fits a natural 
    cubic spline mean curve and and then aligns individual-specific growth  
    curves to the mean  curve via a set of random effects on both effects. 
    For more details,  please see Cole (2010)  <doi:10.1093/ije/dyq115>. 
    The non Bayesian version of the SITAR model can be fit by using an already 
    available R package 'sitar'. However, the 'sitar' package allows modelling  
    of a single outcome only. The 'bsitar' package, in addition to fitting SITAR 
    to a single outcome, offers a great flexibility in fitting models of varying 
    complexities that include joint modelling of multiple outcomes (multivariate 
    model) such as height and weight, and to fit separate models defined by sub 
    group such as gender when analyzing a single outcome. Furthermore, since the 
    'bsitar' package is a front-end to  the R package 'brms', it offers an excellent 
    support for  post-processing of posterior draws which is available from the 
   'brms' package.
