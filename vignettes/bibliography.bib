abstract = {Abstract The shape invariant model is a semi-parametric approach to estimating a function relationship from clustered data (multiple observations on each of a number of individuals). The common response curve shape over individuals is estimated by adjusting for individual scaling differences while pooling shape information. In practice, the common response curve is restricted to some flexible family of functions. This paper introduces the use of a free-knot spline shape function and reduces the number of parameters in the shape invariant model by assuming a random distribution on the parameters that control the individual scaling of the shape function. New graphical diagnostics are presented, parameter identifiability and estimation are discussed, and an example is presented.},

   abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods are becoming ever more popular in applied and fundamental research. In this study a gentle introduction to Bayesian analysis is provided. It is shown under what circumstances it is attractive to use Bayesian estimation, and how to interpret properly the results. First, the ingredients underlying Bayesian methods are introduced using a simplified example. Thereafter, the advantages and pitfalls of the specification of prior knowledge are discussed. To illustrate Bayesian methods explained in this study, in a second example a series of studies that examine the theoretical framework of dynamic interactionism are considered. In the Discussion the advantages and disadvantages of using Bayesian statistics are reviewed, and guidelines on how to report on Bayesian statistics are provided.},
